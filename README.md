# Admin Stealth
 
Admins with flag "b" (default, you can change it with this ConVar **admin_stealth_flag**) will be invisible when they are spectating with **sm_stealth** command.
You can go back to the game by typing the command again.

When you use the command for the first time you will see a message like this **Player Hardix left the game (Disconnected)**. When you want to go back you will see **Hardix joined the game**. You can modify those messages from the translation file.
